What is it for?
---
Using `git init` will allow you to manipulate the specified directory with `git`. 


Example 1 : No options, default values.
---
```
{%- for item in example['1'] %}
{{ item }}
{%- endfor %}
```

Here we first create a directory called `project1`. This will be our new git repository. We make `project1` the current directory by running the `cd` command. Next we create an empty file called `Makefile`. 

Adding the file to git results in an error. Checking the git status also results in an error. The important bit is `not a git repository`. This tells us that you can run `add` and `status` only in a git repository.

The command `git init` makes it a git repository. Since we did not specify any directory or any options, it will process the current directory.

We can then run `git status` and `git add` and it will behave as expected.
