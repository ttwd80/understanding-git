This is another attempt to understand how git works.

As of `2.20.1`, the git documentation page has 8 sections:
1. [Main Porcelain Commands](./section-1/index.md)
2. [Ancillary Commands / Manipulators](./section-2/index.md)
3. [Ancillary Commands / Interrogators](./section-3/index.md)
4. [Interacting with Others](./section-4/index.md)
5. [Low-level Commands / Manipulators](./section-5/index.md)
6. [Low-level Commands / Interrogators](./section-6/index.md)
7. [Low-level Commands / Synching Repositories](./section-7/index.md)
8. [Low-level Commands / Internal Helpers](./section-8/index.md)
